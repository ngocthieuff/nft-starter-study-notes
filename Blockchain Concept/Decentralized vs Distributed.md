# What’s the difference between Decentralized and Distributed ?

Bitcoin’s blockchain protocol, for instance, is a **decentralized** system for exchanging digital cash — but it’s also an example of **distributed** ledger technology. What’s going on?
***
- Centralization and decentralization refer to levels of **control**.
<sub>In a centralized system, control is exerted by just one entity (a person or an enterprise, for example). In a decentralized system, there is no single controlling entity. Instead, control is shared among several independent entities.</sub>
<br/>
- Distribution refers to differences of **location**.
<sub>In a non-distributed (or co-located) system, all the parts of the system are in the same physical location. In a distributed system, parts of the system exist in separate locations.</sub>
