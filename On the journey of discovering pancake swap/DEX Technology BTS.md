# Decentralized Exchange :collision:

### 1. Liquidity Pool:

A liquidity pool is a smart contract where tokens are locked for the purpose of providing liquidity

### Automated Market Maker (AMM):

An automated market maker (AMM) is a type of decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol that relies on a mathematical formula to price assets.

<sub>
The term order book refers to an electronic list of buy and sell orders for a specific security or financial instrument organized by price level.
</sub>

Instead of using an order book like a traditional exchange, assets are priced according to a pricing algorithm.

This formula can vary with each protocol.

With @Uniswap, they use ``x*y=k``
where:
``x`` is the amount of one token in the liquidity pool
``y`` is the amount of the other
``k`` is a fixed constant (the poolâ€™s total liquidity)
