# Decentralized Finance (DeFi) :money_with_wings:

Decentralized finance (or simply DeFi) refers to an ecosystem of financial applications built on blockchain networks. 

### Main advantages:

1. DeFi applications donâ€™t need any intermediaries or arbitrators 
   <br/>
2. Single points of failure are eliminated (as these new financial services are deployed on top of blockchains)
<sub>The data is recorded on the blockchain and spread across thousands of nodes, making censorship or the potential shutdown of a service a complicated undertaking.</sub>
   <br/>
3. The ease of access for individuals who otherwise wouldn't have access to any financial services <sub>(like low-income communities)</sub>

### Potential use cases:

- Borrowing and lending
- Monetary banking services
- Decentralized marketplaces
- Yeild optimization
